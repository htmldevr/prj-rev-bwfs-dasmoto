    <!-- note: I realize I did not follow the exact instructions:
            ~ using hex code for the background-color and the color for the pricing and header text.
            ~ added margin for the h1 which was not specified in the instructions.
            ~ put padding into the h3
            ______

            These choices were made... due to experimentation with dev tool (color picker) and playing with layout/spacing.
